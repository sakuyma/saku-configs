# 🖥️ Installing Neovim

## 📦 Quick Setup

1. **Copy the config:**

You need to copy the `lua` folder and `init.lua` and `lazy-lock.json` files to
the folder: `C:\Users\Your user\AppData\Local\nvim`. If the folder doesn't exist - create it.

2. **Launch Neovim:**

```powershell
nvim
```  
3. **Wait - all plugins will be automatically installed via Lazy.nvim**

## ⚠️ Important!

The first launch will take some time (downloading plugins)

Do not interrupt the installation process

Everything will work instantly afterward

##🎯 What's included:

Tree-style file navigation

Beautiful color scheme

Hotkeys for productive work

# Done! You now have the same Neovim with my settings.
