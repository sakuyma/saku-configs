# 🪟 Installing GlazeWM Config

## 📦 Quick Setup

1. **Copy the config:**

You need to copy the contents of the repository to the folder:
`C:\Users\Your user\AppData\Local\glazewm`. If the folder doesn't exist - create it.

2. **Reload GlazeWM:**

Press the default hotkey: `Win + Shift + R`

3. **Enjoy!** The new configuration is now active.

## ⚠️ Important!

*   Make sure GlazeWM is installed and running.
*   The config uses a specific layout and keybindings – check the `config.yaml` to customize them to your liking.
*   If something doesn't work, check the logs for errors.

## 🎯 What's included:

*   Tiling window management with custom layouts
*   Pre-configured workspaces (virtual desktops)
*   Productive hotkeys for navigation and window control
*   Aesthetic gaps and borders

# Done! You now have a powerful, pre-configured tiling window manager.
